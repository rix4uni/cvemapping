## 🖥️ Affected Software

### **Product**

* **n8n** (Workflow Automation Platform)

### **Affected Versions**

* Versions **≤ 0.121.2**
* Versions **> 0.123.0 and < 1.121.3**
* Affects both:

  * 🏠 **Self-hosted n8n**
  * ☁️ **n8n Cloud**

---

## 🛠️ Technical Details

* **Vulnerability Type:**

  * Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  * Code Injection (**CWE-94**)

* **Root Cause:**

  * Improper handling of **code generation and file operations**
  * Allows **arbitrary file writes** and execution of attacker-controlled code

* **Likely Attack Surface:**

  * Workflow nodes handling file system or Git operations (e.g., **Git node**)
  * Insufficient validation of user-supplied input in workflows

---

## 💥 Exploitation Impact

A successful attacker can:

✔ Execute arbitrary system commands
✔ Read and modify sensitive workflow data
✔ Steal credentials and secrets stored in n8n
✔ Disrupt or delete automation pipelines
✔ Use the compromised instance as a **pivot point** for lateral movement

> ⚠️ Because n8n often integrates with internal systems, cloud APIs, and databases, the **blast radius can be significant**.

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation & Remediation

### ✅ **Recommended Fix (Immediate)**

* 🔄 **Upgrade to n8n version `1.121.3` or later**

### 🔧 **Temporary Workarounds**

If upgrading immediately is not possible:

* ❌ Disable the **Git node** or any nodes that perform file execution
* 🔐 Restrict workflow creation/editing to **trusted users only**
* 📉 Minimize privileges for non-admin accounts

### 🔍 **Detection & Monitoring**

* Review n8n execution logs for:

  * Unexpected command execution
  * Suspicious workflow changes
* Monitor outbound connections from the n8n host
* Watch for privilege escalation indicators on the underlying system

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

* 🔑 Exploitation **requires authentication**, but only **low-privilege access**
* 🔥 Severity is **maximum-level critical**
* 🌐 Impacts both **cloud and self-hosted** deployments
* ⏳ No widespread public PoC yet — **patch before one appears**

---

## 🧠 Advisory Summary

> **CVE-2026-21877 allows authenticated attackers to achieve full remote code execution on vulnerable n8n instances, leading to total system compromise if left unpatched.**
