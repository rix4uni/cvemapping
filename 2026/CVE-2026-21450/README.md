### 🎯 Affected Software

* **Product:** Bagisto (Open-Source eCommerce Platform)
* **Versions:** ❌ *All versions prior to* **2.3.10**
* **Status:** ✅ **Fixed in v2.3.10**

---

### 🧨 Vulnerability Type

**Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**
Untrusted user input is passed into a server-side template engine without proper sanitization.

* **Vulnerable parameter:** `type`
* **Risk:** Arbitrary template execution → possible OS command execution

---

### ⚙️ Technical Breakdown

When malicious input like the following is injected:

```twig
{{ 7 * 7 }}
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/reporting/products/view?type={{7*7}}
```

…and evaluated by the template engine, it confirms code execution.
More advanced payloads can escalate to **full server compromise** depending on environment configuration.

---

### 💥 Potential Impact

* 🖥 Remote Code Execution
* 🔓 Unauthorized access to server resources
* 📦 Data theft or manipulation
* 🧬 Persistent backdoors

---

### 🛡 Mitigation & Remediation

#### ✅ Recommended (Immediate)

* **Upgrade Bagisto to v2.3.10 or later**

#### 🧯 Temporary Controls (If Upgrade Is Delayed)

* Restrict or disable user-controlled template rendering
* Validate and sanitize all template-bound inputs
* Apply WAF rules to block template syntax patterns (`{{ }}`, `{% %}`)

---

### 🧠 Detection Tips

Look for:

* Unexpected template expressions in request logs
* Abnormal server behavior or command execution
* Requests containing `{{`, `{%`, or Blade/Twig syntax

---

### 📌 Notes

* This CVE is **not related** to similarly numbered vulnerabilities (e.g., Qualcomm CVEs).
* Public proof-of-concepts may emerge as awareness grows.
* Particularly dangerous in **admin-exposed or multi-tenant environments**.
