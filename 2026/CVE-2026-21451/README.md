## 🛠️ Root Cause

Bagisto includes an HTML sanitization mechanism intended to remove `<script>` tags from CMS content.
However:

* The sanitization occurs **client-side**
* Attackers can **intercept and modify the raw POST request**
* This bypasses filtering entirely
* Arbitrary JavaScript gets stored in the database

---

## 🎯 Attack Scenario

1. Attacker crafts a CMS page payload
2. Intercepts the POST request (e.g., via Burp)
3. Injects malicious JavaScript
4. Script executes whenever the page is viewed

---

## 💥 Impact

If an administrator views the malicious page, attackers may:

* 🧑‍💻 Hijack admin sessions
* 🔑 Take over backend accounts
* 🗂️ Modify or delete store data
* 🦠 Inject further malware
* 🛒 Compromise customer trust and data

---

## 📦 Affected Versions

❌ **Bagisto < 2.3.10**
✔️ **Bagisto ≥ 2.3.10** (patched)

---

## 🔧 Remediation

✅ **Upgrade immediately to Bagisto 2.3.10 or later**

Additional best practices:

* Enforce **server-side HTML sanitization**
* Apply **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
* Restrict CMS access to trusted roles only

---

## 📊 Severity

* **Medium**
* **CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** ~5.2

---

## 🧠 Takeaway

This vulnerability highlights a classic pitfall:

> ❗ *Client-side validation alone is never sufficient.*

If you manage a Bagisto store, upgrading is essential to prevent admin-level compromise through stored XSS.
