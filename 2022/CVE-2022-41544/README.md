# CVE-2022-41544 Exploit Script

This repository contains a script to exploit CVE-2022-41544 vulnerability in GetSimple CMS. The script performs several steps to check for vulnerabilities, leak API keys, set cookies, obtain CSRF tokens, upload a shell, and trigger the shell.

## Changes and Improvements

1. **Deprecation Warning Handling**: Removed the deprecated `telnetlib` import as it was not necessary for the script's functionality.
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added more robust error handling for HTTP requests and XML parsing.
3. **Improved User Feedback**: Provided detailed feedback for each step to help users understand the script's progress and any issues encountered.
4. **Input Validation**: Ensured that the user inputs for the target, path, and credentials are validated.
5. **Documentation and Comments**: Added comments and documentation to improve code readability and usability.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/n3rdyn3xus/CVE-2022-41544.git
    cd CVE-2022-41544
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the `requests` library.
    ```bash
    pip3 install requests
    ```

3. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python3 CVE-2022-41544.py <target> <path> <ip:port> <username>
    ```

    - `<target>`: The target domain or IP address.
    - `<path>`: The path to the GetSimple CMS installation.
    - `<ip:port>`: The IP and port for the reverse shell.
    - `<username>`: The admin username for the GetSimple CMS.
