# CVE-2025-55182 (React2Shell) Vulnerablity

## **1. Explanation about the Vulnerablity:**

**CVE-2025-55182 (“React2Shell”)** is a **critical Remote Code Execution (RCE)** vulnerability inside **React Server Components (RSC)** — specifically in the **React Flight protocol deserialization logic**.

### Affects:

* React’s server-side engine **incorrectly parses data coming from the browser**.
* An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to your server.
* That request tricks React’s server runtime into executing **arbitrary server-side JavaScript**.
* This allows attackers to:

  * Run commands on your server
  * Steal environment variables (API keys, database passwords, cloud credentials)
  * Install malware or cryptominers
  * Take full control of your backend

### Outcomes:

* **No login required** → attacker does not need an account
* **Works on default installations** → even clean `create-next-app` builds
* **Works reliably** as shown by researchers
* **Already exploited in the wild** by cryptomining groups and credential thieves

If our site uses **React 19** OR **Next.js with the App Router**, we must assume we are vulnerable until patched.

## **2. What has been affected (all packages + versions)**

A complete, verified list of affected packages and versions:

### **React packages (core issue)**

| Package                      | Vulnerable Versions            | Patched Versions       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `react-server-dom-webpack`   | 19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0 | 19.0.1, 19.1.2, 19.2.1 |
| `react-server-dom-parcel`    | same as above                  | same as above          |
| `react-server-dom-turbopack` | same as above                  | same as above          |

These packages are tied to **React Server Components (RSC)** — the root cause.

---

### **Frameworks / tools that bundle the vulnerable React server implementation**

These frameworks use RSC under the hood, so they inherited the vulnerability:

| Framework / Tool                                    | Affected? | Notes                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Next.js (App Router)**                            | Yes       | Most severely impacted. Vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-66478 (now merged into CVE-2025-55182). |
| **Vite RSC Plugin**                                 | Yes       | Any install using React Server Components.                                                        |
| **Parcel RSC Plugin**                               | Yes       | Same reason.                                                                                      |
| **React Router RSC Preview**                        | Yes       | Bundles RSC server logic.                                                                         |
| **RedwoodJS RSC (RedwoodSDK)**                      | Yes       | Uses RSC runtime.                                                                                 |
| **Waku**                                            | Yes       | Experimental RSC-based runtime.                                                                   |
| **Any framework packaging the React 19 RSC server** | Yes       | Must check their advisories.                                                                      |

## **3. How to secure our websites**

The official and complete security guidance for staying safe.

---

### **A. Upgrade immediately (the ONLY full fix)**

#### **If using React directly**

Upgrade to patched versions:

```bash
"react-server-dom-webpack": "19.0.1" or "19.1.2" or "19.2.1"
"react-server-dom-parcel": "same"
"react-server-dom-turbopack": "same"
```

---
 `Run`: 
 ```bash
 npm install react-server-dom-webpack@latest react-server-dom-parcel@latest react-server-dom-turbopack@latest
 ```


---

### **If using Next.js (App Router)**

Upgrade to the patched Next.js versions:

| Major Version | Safe Version                                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 14.x (stable) | Latest 14.x security release                   |
| 15.x          | 15.0.5, 15.1.9, 15.2.6, 15.3.6, 15.4.8, 15.5.7 |
| 16.x          | 16.0.7                                         |

`Run`: 
```bash
npm install next@latest
```

## `Alternative solution (Temporary fix and less Recommended by official documentation)`

### **B. If we cannot upgrade immediately (temporary mitigations)**

These do *not* fully fix the issue — but reduce exposure for a short time:

####  **Block malicious RSC/Flight requests at our WAF**

Block or rate-limit **multipart/form-data POST requests** to:

* `/app/`
* `/actions`
* any RSC route handler

Attackers rely on malformed multipart chunks to trigger the exploit.
