# CVE-2024-32444

As of 24/01/25 this vulnerabiltiy does not have a patch hence this is simply a product detection template as all products associated with the RealHome wordpress theme are vulnerable. 

The theme allows users to register new accounts via the inspiry_ajax_register function, however, it does not properly check authorization or implement a nonce validation.

If registration is enabled on the website, attackers can arbitrarily specify their role as "Administrator" in a specially crafted HTTP request to the registration function, essentially bypassing security checks.

Once registered as an administrator, the attacker can subsequently gain full control of the WordPress site, including performing content manipulation, planting scripts, and accessing user or other sensitive data.

 ## How do I run this script?

1. Download Nuclei from [here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei)
2. Copy the template to your local system
3. Run the following command: `nuclei -u https://yourHost.com -t template.yaml`
