# CVE-2025-60375
CVE-2025-60375 — Authentication bypass / incorrect access control in PerfexCRM &lt; 3.3.1 (admin login)

## Summary
**Vulnerability type:** Incorrect Access Control — Authentication bypass  
**Affected product:** PerfexCRM < 3.3.1  
**CVE:** CVE-2025-60375 (RESERVED)  

**Brief description:**  
The authentication mechanism in PerfexCRM versions prior to 3.3.1 fails to validate username/password parameters server-side. By sending empty username and password parameters in an intercepted login request, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to accounts (including admin accounts).

---

## Affected component
- Admin login / Authentication system

## Attack type
- Remote

## Impact
- Privilege escalation: true (attacker can access administrative dashboard)
- Information disclosure: true (access to account-specific data)

## Reproduction steps (as discovered)
1. Navigate to the PerfexCRM admin login page.  
2. Intercept the login request with a proxy tool (e.g., Burp Suite).  
3. Remove or empty the `username` and `password` parameters in the login request payload (send empty parameters).  
4. Forward the modified request.  
5. Refresh if needed; observe a `419 Page expired` then automatic redirect to the dashboard.  
6. The system grants access without valid credentials.

## Mitigation / Recommended fix
- Implement strict server-side validation for authentication parameters. Reject requests with missing/empty username or password and return an appropriate 4xx response.  
- Ensure session creation and authentication logic are only executed after successful credential validation.  
- Add automated tests that assert empty or missing credentials never result in a successful login.  
- Backport patches to all supported branches and publish CVE / advisory once fixed.

## Severity (suggested)
- High — remote authentication bypass that can directly expose admin accounts. Consider CVSSv3 assessment (example): **7.8 (High)** (authentication bypass / high impact on confidentiality & integrity). This is an example estimate; please compute and publish an official CVSS vector during advisories.
