# Description

This is a PoC for CVE-2025-38352, a race condition vulnerability in the Linux kernel's POSIX CPU timers implementation. The September 2025 Android Bulletin mentions that this vulnerability has been used in limited, targeted exploitation in the wild. 

It was written for LTS 6.12.33, and requires `CONFIG_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK` to be turned off in the kernel config.

For more information on setting up the testing environment, please refer to the blog post linked above, specifically the "Testing Environment TL;DR section".

# Delay patch

The `mdelay_patch.diff` introduces a 500ms delay inside `handle_posix_cpu_timers()`.

The PoC does not strictly require the patch to work, but it makes it much more reliable.
