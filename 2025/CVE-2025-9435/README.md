# CVE-2025-9435
## ADManager Plus Build &lt; 7230 Elevation of Privilege
A technician user with the default `Modify User General Properties` role can escalate their privileges to the service account (if ADManager is installed as a service) or to the user account under which ADManager is running with elevated privileges.


## Proof Of Concept

1. Log in as the technician user and click `Profile Attributes`.
2. Select “Home folder” and “Connect” box type an arbitrary network path. Then enter the name of the logged tecnician user and click search.
3. Capture the request with BurpSuite and set `....\\jre\\lib\\ext\\amd64` value to `homeDirectory` parameter and forward request. 
4. Select the technician user and click “Apply”.
5. A directory named `amd64` will be created under the `C:\Program Files\ManageEngine\ADManager Plus\jre\lib\ext` directory. The technician user has `Full control` over the `amd64` directory.
6. Create malicious `sunmscapi.dll` or `sunec.dll (this DLL could cause the ADManager Plus application to fail to start)` DLL file to obtain reverse shell. 
7. Log in to the server where ADManager is installed as the technician user. Copy the DLL files to `C:\Program Files\ManageEngine\ADManager Plus\jre\lib\ext\amd64`. Under normal conditions, the user can not copy files under the `C:\Program Files\ManageEngine\ADManager Plus\jre\lib\ext\` directory due to insufficient privilege. However, the user obtains write right under the “amd64” directory exploiting arbitrary directory creating vulnerability and can copy these files.
8. After ADManager is restarted, the DLL file will be executed and reverse shell will be obtained with high privileges.
