# CVE-2025-61156

A vulnerability was discovered in the ThreatFire System Monitor (<=[v4.7.0.53](https://threatfire.informer.com/download/)) kernel-mode **TfSysMon.sys** component that allows arbitrary process termination with kernel-mode privileges. As a result, PPL and protected system processes can be forcefully stopped, including but not limited to anti-malware, EDR solutions, agentic clients, and so on. This can result in both local **EDR Bypass** and **Denial of Service**.

As of disclosure, this version of the driver does not appear to be included in [Microsoft's Blocked Drivers List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/design/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules), and can still be abused by threat actors in BYOVD scenarios. Furthermore, the digital signature on the driver appears to remain valid and unrevoked.
