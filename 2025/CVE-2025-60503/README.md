# CVE-2025-60503 ‚Äî Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in UltimatePOS (UltimateFosters) v4.8

**Publication date:** 2025-10-30  
**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-60503 *(RESERVED)*  
**Researcher:** Vivien Lebas  
**Vendor:** UltimateFosters  
**Product:** [UltimatePOS](https://codecanyon.net/item/ultimate-pos-stock-management-point-of-sale-application/21216332)  
**Affected version:** 4.8  
**Vulnerability type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
**Severity:** High  

---

## Overview

A **Stored XSS** vulnerability exists in the **UltimatePOS** admin panel (v4.8).  
The `Reference No.` field in the **Purchases** module accepts unsanitized user input, which is later rendered without proper escaping in the **Reports ‚Üí Activity Log** page.

This allows an attacker with admin access to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of another administrator‚Äôs browser session.

---

## Affected components

Purchases ‚Üí List Purchases ‚Üí + Add
Reports ‚Üí Activity Log


---

## Technical details

When adding a new purchase, the `Reference No.` field value is stored directly and then reflected in the activity log view.  
Because the output is not escaped, any embedded HTML/JavaScript executes when the log is viewed.

---

## üí£ Proof of Concept (PoC)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **For testing purposes only** ‚Äì do not use this PoC on production systems.

1. Log in as an administrator  
2. Navigate to:  

Purchases ‚Üí List Purchases ‚Üí + Add

3. In the **Reference No.** field, insert:

`<script>alert('XSS')</script>`

Fill all required fields, then click Save
Navigate to:
Reports ‚Üí Activity Log
The alert box appears ‚Äî JavaScript executed successfully (stored XSS confirmed)

Impact
Impact	Description
Code execution	Arbitrary JS runs in the admin browser context
Session hijacking	Attacker may steal session tokens
Data theft	Exfiltration of sensitive admin data possible
Phishing	Fake UI overlays or redirection attacks possible
Mitigation & Recommendations

For vendor:

    Sanitize and validate all user input (especially Reference No.)

    Encode output before rendering dynamic values in HTML

    Enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

    Secure cookies (HttpOnly, SameSite=strict)

For users:

    Restrict admin access to trusted users

    Avoid shared admin accounts

    Monitor activity logs for suspicious payloads

    Apply patches immediately once vendor releases them
