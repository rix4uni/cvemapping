## Vulnerability Details
Broken Access Control

# Summary
A Broken Access Control vulnerability in ClassroomIO 0.1.13 allows student-level users to delete published courses without any authorization checks. The “Delete Course” action—intended exclusively for administrators—is improperly exposed on the Explore page, enabling any authenticated student to remove entire courses created by admins. This flaw results in unauthorized data manipulation, loss of learning content, and disruption of platform functionality. The issue stems from missing server-side permission validation, allowing students to bypass role restrictions simply by interacting with the exposed deletion endpoint.

## Steps to Reproduce
Have two accounts Admin (Chromium) and Student (Firefox)

Login as Admin

1. Admin creates a course (live or self-paced) and publishes it online.

Login as Student

2. Student navigates to the Explore page and sees the newly published course.

3. Student has the option to delete

4. Clicks the "Delete" button available alongside the course. Student confirms the deletion.

5. Course gets deleted without requiring any authentication or authorization approval.

Login as Admin

6. Confirm the course is deleted on both end.
