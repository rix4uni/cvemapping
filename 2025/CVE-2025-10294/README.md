### Overview
The vulnerability stems from inadequate validation of the ownid_shared_secret value during JWT-based user authentication, which creates a critical security gap.


### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: requests, argparse (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Usage
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the explоit: `python explоit.py --target <target_url> --file "/path/to/Web.config"`

Options:
- `--target`: URL of the vulnerable CentreStack/TrioFox instance.
- `--file`: Relative path to the file to include (e.g., "../../../../Windows/system.ini" for testing).
- `--proxy`: Optional HTTP proxy for anonymization.


### How It Works
An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to log in as any user on the WordPress site, including administrator accounts. This allows complete unauthorized access to the WordPress site, potentially leading to data theft, site manipulation, malware injection, or complete site compromise.
