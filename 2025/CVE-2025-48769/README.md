## NuttX RTOS fs_rename UAF Exploit PoC (CVE-2025-48769)

This PoC targets the use-after-free in fs_rename() within NuttX VFS layer, versions <=12.10.x. Triggered remotely via crafted filesystem ops over network-mounted FS (e.g., NFS-like setup or custom RPC). No auth, leading to arbitrary read/write via dangling inode ptr.

### Disclaimer 

This exploit PoC is for educational and research purposes only. Use at your own risk; the author disclaims liability for any misuse, damages.

Exploit flow:
1. Establish remote FS conn to target NuttX device.
2. Send concurrent rename reqs on same file, forcing partial free in VFS cache.
3. Spray heap with controlled data to overwrite freed inode.
4. Trigger deref for RCE—pivot to kernel shell or data exfil.

Tested on ARM-based embedded setups. Requires target with exposed FS interface. Payload in C, compiles with arm-none-eabi-gcc. Includes setup script for qemu emulation.

Run against target: `./exp TARGET_IP`
