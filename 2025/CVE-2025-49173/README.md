# CVE-2025-49173 — macOS 10.9 Local Root Privilege Escalation (Research)

> **Status:** Unofficial / Research-Based  
> **Platform:** macOS Mavericks (10.9)  
> **Impact:** Local Privilege Escalation → Root  
> **Severity:** High (Local)

This repository contains a **proof-of-concept (PoC) security research project** focused on a **local root privilege escalation vulnerability** affecting **macOS Mavericks (10.9)**.  
The CVE identifier used here is **unofficial and for academic demonstration purposes only**.

---

## Overview

This research analyzes a privilege escalation attack vector that allows a **local unprivileged user** to escalate permissions and obtain **root-level access** under specific misconfiguration and authorization handling conditions in legacy macOS systems.

The project focuses on:
- macOS authorization mechanisms  
- Legacy privilege boundaries  
- User-to-root attack surface analysis  

---

## Affected Systems

- macOS Mavericks **10.9**
- Other legacy macOS versions may be affected (not fully tested)

---

## Vulnerability Class

- Local Privilege Escalation (LPE)
- Authorization Misconfiguration
- Improper Privilege Boundary Enforcement

---

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

This repository includes:
- A controlled PoC implementation  
- Step-by-step privilege escalation flow  
- Logs demonstrating successful root-level execution  

> ⚠️ The PoC is provided for **educational and defensive security research only**.

---

## Mitigation & Recommendations

- Disable unused legacy authorization services  
- Apply strict file and binary permission hardening  
- Monitor abnormal privilege transitions  
- Avoid using unsupported legacy macOS versions in production environments
