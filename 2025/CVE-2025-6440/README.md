## Install & Use

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- `requests`
- `colorama`

Usage :

```
python3 exploit.py --url http://example.com/ --file shell.php --verbose
```

Notes:

--url : target base URL (script normalizes it).

--file : local file to upload.

--verbose : optional detailed output.

The script saves:

downloaded_<uniq>.bin

extracted_<uniq>.php (extracted PHP fragment if found)

## Mitigation

Update WooCommerce Designer Pro to the patched version when available.
Prevent PHP execution in upload directories. Example nginx:

```
location ~* /wp-content/uploads/.*\.(php|phtml|php[0-9]*)$ {
    return 403;
}
```

Validate uploaded file types and scan file contents server-side.
Restrict access to AJAX endpoints where possible and monitor upload activity.
