## Overview

**Chartify WordPress Plugin Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2025-11171)** - Critical security flaw allowing unauthenticated access to administrative functions in WordPress chart building plugin.

A critical authentication bypass vulnerability was discovered in the Chartify WordPress Chart Plugin that allows unauthenticated attackers to execute administrative functions.

**Discovered by:** Kai Aizen & Avraham Shemesh (SnailSploit)  
**Published:** October 7, 2025  
**CVSS Score:** 5.3 (Medium)  
**CWE:** CWE-306 - Missing Authentication for Critical Function  
**Plugin:** Chartify – WordPress Chart Plugin  
**Attack Type:** Unauthenticated AJAX Admin Function Execution  
**Required Privileges:** None (Unauthenticated Attack)

## Vulnerability Details

### Description

The Chartify WordPress Chart Plugin contains a missing authentication vulnerability in all versions up to and including 3.5.9. The plugin registers an unauthenticated AJAX action that dispatches to admin-class methods based on a request parameter without any nonce or capability checks.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to:
- Execute administrative functions via the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint
- Bypass authentication controls
- Potentially manipulate plugin settings and data

### Affected Versions

- **Vulnerable:** All versions ≤ 3.5.9
- **Patched:** Version 3.6.0 and above

### CVSS v3.1 Metrics

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
```

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Attack Vector | Network (AV:N) |
| Attack Complexity | Low (AC:L) |
| Privileges Required | None (PR:N) |
| User Interaction | None (UI:N) |
| Scope | Unchanged (S:U) |
| Confidentiality | None (C:N) |
| Integrity | Low (I:L) |
| Availability | None (A:N) |

## Technical Details

The vulnerability exists in the AJAX handler implementation where:

1. The plugin registers an unauthenticated AJAX action
2. This action dispatches to admin-class methods based on request parameters
3. No nonce validation is performed
4. No capability checks are implemented
5. Attackers who can identify callable method names can invoke them directly

### Attack Vector

```
POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php
```

The vulnerability can be exploited through the WordPress admin-ajax.php endpoint without authentication, provided the attacker can identify valid method names.

## Remediation

### For Site Administrators

**Immediate Action Required:**

1. Update to Chartify version **3.6.0** or later immediately
2. Review your site's access logs for suspicious AJAX requests to `admin-ajax.php`
3. If you cannot update immediately, consider temporarily disabling the plugin

### Update Instructions

1. Navigate to **Plugins > Installed Plugins** in WordPress admin
2. Locate "Chartify – WordPress Chart Plugin"
3. Click **Update Now** to upgrade to version 3.6.0 or later
4. Verify the update was successful

### For Developers

Ensure all AJAX handlers implement proper security controls:

```php
// Example of proper AJAX security
add_action('wp_ajax_your_action', 'your_callback');

function your_callback() {
    // Verify nonce
    check_ajax_referer('your_nonce_action', 'nonce');
    
    // Check capabilities
    if (!current_user_can('manage_options')) {
        wp_die('Unauthorized');
    }
    
    // Your secure code here
}
```
