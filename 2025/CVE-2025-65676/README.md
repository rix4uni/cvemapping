 Stored Cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Classroomio LMS 0.1.13 allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted SVG cover images. Discovered by - Rivek Raj Tamang (RivuDon), Sikkim, India.

**Affected Product: ClassroomIO**
* Affected Version: 0.1.13
* **Discovered by: Rivek Raj Tamang (RivuDon), Sikkim, India**

## Vulnerability Details
Stored Cross Site Scripting

# Summary
A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Classroomio LMS version 0.1.13, where the application fails to sanitize course cover image uploads. An authenticated attacker can upload a malicious SVG file containing embedded JavaScript, which is then stored and executed whenever the course cover image is viewed. Because the payload is executed from a trusted domain, this flaw can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, redirection attacks, or further exploitation within the platform.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Log in and go to created course or create one

2. Click on landing page

3. Click on Header > replace image cover

3. Select the xss svg file and click on upload

4. Wait for it to save, refresh the page
