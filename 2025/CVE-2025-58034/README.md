# 🔒 🚨 CVE-2025-58034: FortiWeb OS Command Injection Zero-Day 🔥

![FortiWeb 0-Day Code Execution Vulnerability](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee709fb2-149d-44b8-a7f0-d35909a3ed5a)

**Professional Security Bulletin** | *Issued: November 19, 2025* | *Status: Actively Exploited Zero-Day*  
*Fortinet FortiWeb Web Application Firewall (WAF) – Immediate Action Required* 🛡️

---

## 📋 Executive Summary
Fortinet has disclosed **CVE-2025-58034**, a **high-severity OS Command Injection vulnerability** (CVSS 7.2) in its FortiWeb product line. This flaw allows **authenticated attackers** to execute arbitrary operating system commands via crafted HTTP requests or CLI inputs, potentially leading to full system compromise.  

**Critical Alert**: Exploitation has been observed in the wild since early November 2025, with cybersecurity firm Trend Micro detecting **~2,000 exploit attempts**. This marks the **second FortiWeb zero-day** in under a week (following CVE-2025-64446, CVSS 9.1). The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added it to its **Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog**, mandating federal agencies to patch by **November 25, 2025**.  

**Recommendation**: Upgrade to patched versions immediately. Review logs for unauthorized command execution and restrict admin access.  

*Reported by*: Jason McFadyen (Trend Micro) under Fortinet's responsible disclosure program.  
*Advisory ID*: FG-IR-25-028 (Fortinet PSIRT).

## 🎯 Vulnerability Details
| **Attribute**              | **Details**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CVE ID**                 | CVE-2025-58034                                                             |
| **Description**            | An **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')** vulnerability [CWE-78]. Authenticated attackers can inject and execute unauthorized OS commands on the underlying system. |
| **Severity**               | **Medium** (CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.7/10.0)                                 |
| **CVSS Vector**            | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H <br> - **Attack Vector**: Network (remote) <br> - **Attack Complexity**: Low <br> - **Privileges Required**: Low (authenticated) <br> - **User Interaction**: None <br> - **Scope**: Unchanged <br> - **Impact (C/I/A)**: High (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) |
| **Attack Requirements**    | Requires valid authentication (e.g., admin credentials). Can be chained with auth bypass flaws (like CVE-2025-64446) for unauthenticated RCE. |
| **Disclosure Date**        | November 18, 2025                                                          |
| **Patch Availability**     | Yes – Released November 18, 2025                                            |

**Technical Root Cause**: The flaw arises from inadequate sanitization of user-supplied inputs in CLI commands and HTTP API endpoints, allowing injection of OS commands (e.g., `; id` or `&& cat /etc/passwd`).

## 🖥️ Affected Products & Versions
FortiWeb versions vulnerable to arbitrary command execution:  

| **Product** | **Affected Versions**                  | **Patched Versions**                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **FortiWeb** | 7.6.0 – 7.6.5 <br> 7.4.0 – 7.4.10 <br> 7.2.0 – 7.2.11 <br> 7.0.0 – 7.0.11 <br> **8.0.0 – 8.0.1** | Upgrade to: <br> 7.6.6+ <br> 7.4.11+ <br> 7.2.12+ <br> 7.0.12+ <br> **8.0.2+** |

*Note*: This vulnerability has existed since at least early 2023 (introduction of 7.0.0). All deployments on affected versions should be scanned and updated.

## ⚔️ Exploitation Status & Threat Landscape
- **Active Exploitation**: Confirmed by Fortinet – attackers are leveraging this for **remote code execution (RCE)** post-authentication. Trend Micro reported **2,000+ attempts** globally, targeting exposed FortiWeb instances.  
- **Attack Vector**: Crafted HTTP/HTTPS requests to management interfaces (e.g., API endpoints like `/api/v2/cmdb/system/interface`). Indicators include anomalous command echoes in logs (e.g., `uid=0(root)`).  
- **Threat Actors**: No specific attribution, but aligns with patterns from state-sponsored groups (e.g., Volt Typhoon's prior Fortinet exploits).  
- **Real-World Impact**: Potential for data exfiltration, backdoor installation, or lateral movement in protected networks. Recent X discussions highlight chaining with CVE-2025-64446 for unauthenticated access.  
- **PoC Availability**: No public exploits yet, but the CWE-78 nature makes it straightforward for skilled adversaries.  

**Recent X Buzz** (Latest as of Nov 19, 2025):  
- Security pros urge immediate patching: "Fortinet reports active exploitation... patch immediately and review traffic logs."  
- Latvian CERT warns: "High-risk vulnerability... exploitation observed in cyberspace."  
- Polish analyst notes: "Another FortiWeb vuln! 0-day in real attacks... CISA added to KEV."

## 🛡️ Mitigation & Remediation
### Immediate Actions  
1. **Patch Priority**: Upgrade to the latest fixed release (see table above). Download from Fortinet Support Portal.  
2. **Access Controls**:  
   - Restrict management interface to trusted IP ranges (e.g., via firewall rules).  
   - Enforce **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for all admin accounts.  
   - Apply **least-privilege principles** – avoid high-priv accounts for routine tasks.  
3. **Monitoring**:  
   - Audit logs for suspicious CLI/HTTP activity (e.g., injection patterns like `;`, `&&`, or `%0a`).  
   - Enable anomaly detection on WAF rulesets.  
4. **Workarounds** (If Patching Delayed):  
   - Disable CLI access over HTTP/HTTPS if unused.  
   - Use network segmentation to isolate FortiWeb.  

### Post-Exploitation Checks  
- Review configurations for unauthorized changes (e.g., new admin accounts).  
- Scan for persistence (e.g., cron jobs, backdoors).  
- Tools: Nessus, OpenVAS, or FortiGuard scanners for detection.  

**CISA Guidance**: Federal entities must apply mitigations by Nov 25, 2025, due to "significant risks to the federal enterprise."
