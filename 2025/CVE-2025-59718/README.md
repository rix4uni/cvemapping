### **Critical Security Vulnerability — CVSS 9.8**

---

## 🔥 **Overview**

**CVE-2025-59718** is a **critical authentication bypass vulnerability** affecting multiple Fortinet products that use **FortiCloud Single Sign-On (SSO)**.
An attacker can gain unauthorized access **without credentials** by sending a maliciously crafted **SAML response** due to **improper cryptographic signature verification**.

---

## 🛑 **Why It Matters**

* ✘ No credentials required
* ✘ Remote exploitation
* ✘ Complete authentication bypass
* ✘ Attack chain is simple and high-impact
* ✔ Affects widely deployed enterprise security appliances

---

## 🧩 **Root Cause**

> **CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature**

Fortinet’s SSO system fails to sufficiently validate the authenticity of SAML signatures, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate SSO responses.
