# ⚠️ Security Advisory: DOM-Based XSS in Electric-Shop E-commerce (GitHub Project)  
**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-63883  
**Severity:** Medium–High  
**Weakness:** CWE-79 — DOM-Based XSS

## 📝 Summary  
A **DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability exists in **E-commerce Electric-Shop v1.0** hosted at: https://github.com/Bhabishya-123/E-commerce  

The search feature uses **unsafe DOM sinks** such as `innerHTML`, allowing attacker-controlled data from the URL or search parameters to be executed in the victim’s browser without sanitization.

## 🎯 Affected Component  
Search input & related frontend JavaScript logic

Live vulnerable instance used during testing: https://electronicstorenepal.42web.io/

## 🧪 Proof of Concept  
An attacker can craft a malicious URL using: `#"><img src=/ onerror=alert(2)>`

Opening this URL causes the payload to execute.

## ⚡ Impact  
**• Arbitrary JavaScript Execution in Victim Browser**  
**• Session Token Theft / Credential Stealing**  
**• Account Takeover & Privilege Abuse**  
**• Persistent Client-Side Pivot Attacks**

## 🔧 Remediation  
**• Remove unsafe DOM sinks (innerHTML, insertAdjacentHTML, document.write)**  
**• Use safe DOM APIs (textContent, setAttribute)**  
**• Sanitize untrusted client-side input**  
**• Apply strict Content Security Policy (CSP)**
