# CVE-2025-60378
CVE-2025-60378 — Stored HTML Injection in RISE — Ultimate Project Manager &amp; CRM &lt; 3.9.4 (Invoices &amp; Messaging)

## Summary

Vulnerability type: Stored HTML Injection (improper output encoding / insufficient input sanitization)

Affected product: RISE — Ultimate Project Manager & CRM < 3.9.4

CVE: CVE-2025-60378 (RESERVED)

## Brief description:
RISE CRM versions prior to 3.9.4 allow authenticated users to inject arbitrary HTML into invoice line items, messages, and client notes. Injected HTML persists in the database and is automatically included in client-facing emails, PDFs, and messaging modules, including recurring invoices. This enables large-scale phishing, business email compromise, and email/PDF-based malware delivery.

## Affected component

Invoice line items (description field)

Client note/messaging module

Client statement generation module

Automated email system (recurring invoices, reminders)

PDF attachments

## Attack type

Remote

## Impact

Privilege escalation: false (requires authenticated user)

Information disclosure: true

Phishing / Business Email Compromise: true

Malware delivery via email/PDF: true

## Reproduction steps:

Log in to the RISE CRM admin panel with an account that can create/edit invoices or send messages.

Create a new invoice, message, or edit client notes.

Inject the HTML payload into the relevant fields.

Save the record. The system automatically sends emails or generates PDFs containing the injected HTML.

Observe that the malicious HTML renders in client emails, PDFs, and chat/messaging modules.

Optionally, set up recurring invoices/messages to verify automated distribution.

Example payload:
```html
<a href="https://attacker.com">Click here to view invoice</a>
<a href="https://evil.com" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://media1.giphy.com/.../giphy.gif">
</a>
<h1><font color=red>Visit Our New WebSite</font></h1>
<h3><mark><a href="https://evil.com">https://www.paytm.com/</a></mark></h3>
```

## Mitigation / Recommended fix

Sanitize and encode all user-supplied content in invoices, messages, and client notes.

Disable HTML rendering in client-facing templates or force proper escaping.

Restrict editing privileges for non-admin accounts.

Implement automated tests to ensure malicious HTML cannot render in client communications.

## Severity (suggested)

High — stored HTML injection with automated email/PDF/message distribution can enable large-scale phishing, BEC, and malware delivery.
CVSS v3.1 vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N → 8.1 (High)
> Note: This is an estimated vector for triage. Provide a precise CVSS vector after coordinated disclosure.
