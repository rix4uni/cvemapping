* Affected Version: 0.1.13
* **Discovered by: Rivek Raj Tamang (RivuDon), Sikkim, India**

## Vulnerability Details
Stored Cross Site Scripting

# Summary
A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Classroomio LMS version 0.1.13, where the application fails to sanitize SVG profile image uploads. An authenticated attacker can upload a malicious SVG file containing embedded JavaScript, which is then stored and executed whenever the profile image is viewed. Because the payload is executed from a trusted domain, this flaw can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, redirection attacks, or further exploitation within the platform.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Log in and go to profile settings

2. Click on upload image

3. Select the xss svg file and click on upload

4. Wait for it to save
