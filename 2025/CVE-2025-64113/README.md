# ✨ CVE-2025-64113 — Critical Emby Server Vulnerability

![Critical Emby Server Vulnerability Let Attackers Gain Admin Access (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bd2a844-210a-4dba-89f2-26026a7ec315)

**Weak Password Recovery Mechanism → Full Admin Takeover**

---

## 🔍 Overview

**CVE-2025-64113** is a *critical* vulnerability found in **Emby Server**, caused by an insecure password-recovery workflow.
An attacker with simple **network access** — no login, no privileges — can escalate to **full administrative control** of the Emby application.

---

## 🧨 Severity

* **CVSS v3:** 9.8 (Critical)
* **CVSS v4:** 9.3
* **Attack vector:** Network
* **Requirements:** None (no authentication, no user interaction)
* **Impact:** Complete administrative compromise of the Emby Server instance

---

## 🛑 What Attackers Can Do

Once exploited, an attacker may:

* Reset or take over administrator accounts
* Create or delete Emby users
* Modify or delete media libraries
* Change system settings or plugins
* Use the server as a pivot point for additional attacks
  *(Note: does **not** automatically grant OS-level access.)*

---

## 🖥️ Affected Versions

* **Vulnerable:** Emby Server ≤ **4.9.1.80** (stable + beta)
* **Fixed:** **4.9.1.81+**

---

## 🛡️ How to Protect Yourself

### ✅ **1. Update Immediately**

Upgrade to **Emby Server 4.9.1.81 or later** — the direct, permanent fix.

---

### 🩹 **2. Temporary Workaround** (if you cannot update yet)

Restrict or create the file:

```
passwordreset.txt
```

**Linux:**

```bash
chmod 444 passwordreset.txt
```

**Windows:**
Deny permissions for **Authenticated Users**.

This prevents exploitation of the vulnerable password-reset endpoint.

---

### 🔒 Additional Hardening (Highly Recommended)

* Limit Emby Server exposure to the internet
* Place it behind a VPN or firewall
* Restrict access to trusted IPs
* Monitor for unusual admin logins or sudden user creation

---

## 🌐 Why It Matters

This vulnerability is dangerous because:

* It’s **trivially exploitable**
* It yields **full admin control**
* Emby servers are often **internet-exposed**
* Media servers often sit on home/enterprise networks, creating pivot opportunities
