# Description

1. CVE-2025-14221
2. Discoverer: Fatma Trabelsi
3. Vendor of Product: SourceCodester
4. Affected Product: Online Banking System 1.0

# POC
A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the User Profile Update functionality of the application. The application fails to properly sanitize user‑supplied input in the First Name field before storing it in the database and rendering it across multiple pages.

An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the First Name field, which will be executed every time any user (including administrators) views a page where that profile information is displayed. This allows attackers to perform actions such as session hijacking, credential theft, DOM manipulation, and full takeover of any account that loads the malicious profile data.
