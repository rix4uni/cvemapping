# CVE-2025-56643
Public reference for CVE-2025-56643 – Wiki.js 2.5.307 JWT Session Vulnerability


**Description:**  
Requarks Wiki.js 2.5.307 does not properly revoke or invalidate active JWT tokens when a user logs out.

Wiki.js – version 2.5.307  

**Affected Component:**  
GraphQL API endpoint (`/graphql`), Authentication module, JWT session management, logout logic (UI and backend).

**Impact:**  
Allows reuse of previously issued JWT tokens after logout, compromising session validity and user authentication.

**Vulnerability Type:**  
CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration

**Attack Vector:**  
Remote – An attacker with access to a previously issued token can continue using it after logout to perform authenticated actions.

**Discoverer:**
