## 🚀 Script Features

- Ultra-fast site scanning (multi-threaded execution for large lists)
- Auto-detects and extracts all available private/public keys, tokens, and authentication info for every accessible account.
- Mass exploitation — identifies multiple vulnerable accounts per site.
- Reliable credential extraction — validates credentials during exploitation.
- Output to four structured files:
  - `exposures.txt` — Found exposures and credentials.
  - `tokens.txt` — JWT tokens extracted.
  - `exploited_sites.txt` — Sites with multiple exposed accounts.
  - `cookies.txt` — Session cookies from successful exploitation.
- Requires no authentication or elevated privileges.
- Resilient to network failures and blockages; recovers and retries transparently.
- Thread-safe file writing for consistent results.
