# CVE-2025-62410

### Overview
The vulnerability allows attackers to run untrusted scripts in the same Isolate/process, potentially enabling prototype pollution attacks that can hijack critical references like "process" or manipulate control flow by exploiting undefined property checks.


### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: requests, argparse (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Usage
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the explоit: `python explоit.py --target <target_url> --file "/path/to/Web.config"`

Options:
- `--target`: URL of the vulnerable CentreStack/TrioFox instance.
- `--file`: Relative path to the file to include (e.g., "../../../../Windows/system.ini" for testing).
- `--proxy`: Optional HTTP proxy for anonymization.


### How It Works
Attackers can potentially: - Execute arbitrary code - Hijack critical system references - Manipulate application control flow - Compromise system confidentiality, integrity, and availability The vulnerability allows network-based attacks with no user interaction required, posing a critical risk to system security.
