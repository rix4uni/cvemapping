# CVE-2025-4476-Exploit

A small Python test client to send HTTP GET requests with an oversized Authorization: Basic header.
This tool is intended for lab testing and research into header-parsing issues (e.g., null-dereference / crash bugs such as CVE-2025-4476 in libsoup). It demonstrates how a client-server exchange with malformed headers can trigger parsing errors; it is not an exploit framework.

Usage: run against a local or authorized test target only.
Important: use responsibly â€” do not scan or attack systems without explicit permission.
