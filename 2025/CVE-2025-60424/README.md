# 2FA Bypass Using a Brute Force Attack

## Overview
The Nagios Fusion application (version 2024R1.2 and 2024R2) is vulnerable to a Brute-Force attack on its Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) mechanism. Specifically, the 2FA implementation does not adequately enforce rate-limiting or account lockout mechanisms, allowing an attacker to bypass 2FA by repeatedly guessing the One-Time Password (OTP).

**The following issues were observed:**
- **Lack of Rate-Limiting**: The 2FA endpoint does not limit the number of OTP submission attempts.
- **Weak Lockout Policy**: No account lockout is triggered after repeated failed OTP attempts, enabling brute-force attacks to succeed.
- **Potential for Unauthorized Access**: With sufficient computational resources, an attacker could bypass 2FA and gain unauthorized access to sensitive accounts, including administrator accounts.

*This vulnerability stems from the absence of proper defences against brute-force attacks, rendering the 2FA mechanism ineffective against targeted attacks.*

## Severity
- **Severity**: High
- **CWE**: CWE-307 (primary); CWE-287 (secondary)
- **CVSS Score (v3.0)**: 7.6 High
- **CVSS Vector**: AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

## Affected Components
- 2FA Verification Endpoint (e.g., /verify-otp)
- Authentication Middleware
- Session Issuance Service
- Rate Limiting / Anti-Automation Controls

## Affected Vendor/Product
- **Product Name**- Nagios Fusion
- **Affected Version**: 2024R1.2 and 2024R2
- **Fixed Version**: 2024R2.1

## Summary of the Issue
**What Happens:**
1. User attempts login with valid username and password.
2. System prompts for OTP from authenticator app/SMS/email.
3. Attacker scripts automated requests to /verify-otp endpoint.
4. Due to lack of rate limiting and lockout, attacker can attempt unlimited guesses.
5. Within feasible time, attacker predicts correct OTP and bypasses 2FA.

**Security Posture Gap**:
2FA is meant to increase entropy and reduce brute-force feasibility. Without proper anti-automation controls, OTP becomes brute-forceable, negating the second factor.

**Abuse Scenarios**:
- Automated credential stuffing + brute-force OTP to achieve mass account takeover.
- Targeted attack against high-value accounts where password was phished or leaked.

## Mitigation Recommendations
- Enforce strict rate limiting per account/IP/device for OTP attempts.
- Lock account after N failed OTP attempts and require re-authentication.
- Introduce back-off delays (e.g., exponential) on repeated failures.
