# CVE-2025-63943 — SQL Injection in Grocery Store Management System 1.0

## Overview
A high-severity **SQL Injection** vulnerability was identified in the `search_products.php` component of **Grocery Store Management System 1.0**, a PHP/MySQL-based web application created by *anirudhkannan*.  
The issue arises from improper input validation and unsafe construction of SQL queries using the user-controlled `scost` parameter. This flaw enables attackers to manipulate the underlying SQL logic, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure, data alteration, or full compromise of the database.

---

## Affected Product
- **Name:** Grocery Store Management System  
- **Vendor:** anirudhkannan  
- **Version:** 1.0  
- **Repository:**  
  https://github.com/anirudhkannanvp/GROCERY-STORE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-USING-PHP-AND-MYSQL-PHPMYADMIN-/tree/master  
- **Affected File:**  
  `Grocery/search_products.php`

---

## Vulnerability Description
The vulnerability exists due to the **direct concatenation of unvalidated user input** into SQL queries.  
The `scost` POST parameter, intended to represent a numeric product cost value, is embedded into the SQL WHERE clause without:

- Input sanitization  
- Type enforcement  
- Parameterized queries  
- Prepared statement usage  

This allows an attacker to inject **arbitrary SQL boolean expressions**, altering query behavior and extracting database contents using **boolean-based SQL Injection** techniques.

The vulnerability is exploitable through a standard POST request to `search_products.php`. When malicious expressions are supplied, the backend returns measurable response differences (TRUE/FALSE variations), confirming that user input influences SQL logic.

---

## Root Cause
- Lack of server-side validation on the `scost` input field  
- Direct use of string concatenation for building SQL queries  
- Absence of prepared statements in the affected code path  
- No filtering or whitelisting for numeric input fields  

These conditions collectively enable attackers to modify the intended SQL logic.

---

## Severity & Impact
This vulnerability is rated **High** due to its low attack complexity, lack of authentication requirements, and full read/write database impact.

### Potential Impacts Include:
- **Sensitive data exposure:** Attackers may extract product, user, or system data.  
- **Data modification or deletion:** Injected SQL can alter or remove database entries.  
- **Authentication bypass (possible):** If used in other parts of the application’s query logic.  
- **Full database compromise:** Depending on DB privileges and configuration.  
- **System instability:** Malicious queries could disrupt normal application behavior.

## CVSS v3.1 Score (Preliminary Assessment)
**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network  
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low  
- **Privileges Required (PR):** None  
- **User Interaction (UI):** None  
- **Scope (S):** Unchanged  
- **Confidentiality (C):** High  
- **Integrity (I):** High  
- **Availability (A):** High  

**Estimated Severity: High (9.8)**

---

## Exploitation Summary
The vulnerability can be exploited through crafted values passed to the `scost` parameter.  
Attackers can:

- Influence boolean logic  
- Trigger conditional responses  
- Enumerate database structures  
- Extract sensitive information  

*(Detailed payloads are intentionally omitted to prevent misuse.)*

## Mitigation & Recommendations

### For Developers / Vendors
To remediate the vulnerability:

1. **Implement prepared statements / parameterized queries**  
2. **Enforce strict input validation** — ensure `scost` accepts only numeric values  
3. **Reject suspicious characters** — filter operators, quotes, comments, and expression symbols  
4. **Apply least-privilege database permissions**  
5. **Audit the codebase** for similar patterns elsewhere in the application  

### For Users
Until a patch is available:

- Restrict public access to the application  
- Use a firewall or WAF to block malicious requests  
- Monitor logs for unusual SQL-related behavior
