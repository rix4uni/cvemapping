  name: CVE-2025-37164 - HPE OneView Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution
  author: rxerium
  severity: critical
  description: |
    CVE-2025-37164 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in HPE OneView with a maximum CVSS score of 10.0. The vulnerability stems from improper control of code generation (CWE-94), allowing unauthenticated threat actors to exploit the flaw via low-complexity code injection attacks over the network. No privileges or user interaction are required for exploitation, and successful attacks can grant total control over data centers. The vulnerability affects all HPE OneView versions released before v11.00 (specifically versions 5.20 through 10.20). HPE has released version 11.00 and security hotfixes for affected versions to address this critical flaw.
