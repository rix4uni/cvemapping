# 🔐 CVE-2025-62593 — What You Need to Know

## 🧩 What Is It?

CVE-2025-62593 is a **critical vulnerability** in **Ray**, the distributed AI/ML compute framework.
It affects **versions before 2.52.0** and allows **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** via browser-based attacks 🚨.

The flaw comes from Ray trying to block attacks by checking if the `User-Agent` header starts with `"Mozilla"` — but modern browsers can change that header 🕵️‍♂️.
This makes the protection ineffective.

The attack works through **DNS rebinding**, which tricks the browser into thinking a malicious remote server is actually `localhost`, allowing it to hit Ray’s unauthenticated endpoints like:

* `/api/jobs`
* `/api/job_agent/jobs/`

These endpoints can execute code on your machine 😬.

## ⚠️ Severity & Impact

* **CVSS v3:** 8.1 (High) 🔶
* **CVSS v4:** 9.4 (Critical) 🔴

This can lead to **full system compromise** just by visiting a website in **Safari or Firefox** while Ray is running locally.
Chrome isn’t affected in the same way (due to quirks in its implementation) 💻✨.

---

## 🎯 Who’s at Risk?

You are affected if:

* You’re running **Ray < 2.52.0**
* Ray’s dashboard/API is running locally
* You browse the web with **Safari or Firefox** 🦊 🍎
* You visit a malicious site or an infected ad triggers DNS rebinding 🌐💥

This mostly targets **developers running Ray locally** for ML/AI tasks.

## 🛡️ How to Protect Yourself

### ✅ 1. **Upgrade Ray**

Update to **Ray 2.52.0 or later** — the vulnerability is patched there.
🚀 *Easiest and strongest protection.*

### 🛑 2. Stop Using Risky Browsers While Ray Is Running

If you cannot update:

* Avoid *untrusted* websites in **Firefox/Safari**
* Prefer **Chrome** temporarily (safer in this context)

### 🔐 3. Harden Your Setup

* Shut down Ray’s dashboard when not needed
* Avoid exposing API endpoints unnecessarily
* Do not rely on weak checks like `User-Agent` headers

---

## 🌍 Why It Matters

This vulnerability shows how **simple header checks** are not real security boundaries.
With methods like DNS rebinding becoming more common, developers running local tools can be compromised by **just visiting a website** 😨.

As AI tools like Ray grow rapidly, these risks affect more teams and workflows every day.
