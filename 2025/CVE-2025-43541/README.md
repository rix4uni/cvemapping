# CVE-2025-43541

WARNING: POTENTIALLY UNSAFE CODE

This repository contains a JavaScript / HTML Proof of Concept (PoC) related to a potential WebKit / JavaScriptCore vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-43541.

---

## Disclaimer

This code may be unsafe.

Running this HTML file can crash the browser, especially Safari on iOS.  
Possible effects include browser tab crashes, Safari freezes, restarts, or excessive memory usage.

This project interacts with low-level JavaScript engine behavior, including:
- Resizable ArrayBuffer
- Dynamic buffer resizing
- DataView access with offsets
- Repeated byteLength access in tight loops

Use this code entirely at your own risk.  
The author takes no responsibility for any damage, data loss, device instability, or unexpected behavior caused by running this code.

---

## Description

This Proof of Concept demonstrates abnormal behavior involving:

- ArrayBuffer with maxByteLength
- resize() calls during active access
- DataView created with manual offsets
- Repeated execution loops designed to stress JavaScriptCore

The purpose is to trigger engine instability or crashes for research and testing.

---

## Intended Use

This project is intended only for:

- Security research
- WebKit / JavaScriptCore analysis
- Educational purposes
- Vulnerability testing

This code is not intended for production use.  
Do not deploy it on public websites.  
Do not open it on your primary or daily-use device.

---

## Platform Notes

Safari on iOS is particularly sensitive to this type of code.

Behavior may vary depending on:
- iOS version
- WebKit / JavaScriptCore revision
- Device architecture
- Desktop versus mobile Safari

Some features used in this project may be partially implemented, restricted, or intentionally disabled by Apple for security reasons.

---

## Important Notice

If you are not familiar with:
- JavaScript engine internals
- Memory safety concepts
- Browser exploitation techniques

Do not run this code.
