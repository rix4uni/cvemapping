# CVE-2025-55462
---

## Vulnerability Summary

A **CORS misconfiguration** was identified in **Eramba Community and Enterprise Editions v3.26.0**, where the application reflects attacker-controlled `Origin` headers in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response while also setting `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.

This behavior violates the **Same-Origin Policy** and allows **authenticated cross-origin requests** from malicious websites. If a victim is logged into an affected Eramba instance and visits an attacker-controlled page, the attacker’s JavaScript can read sensitive API responses.

---

## Affected Components

- CORS middleware / Origin validation logic  
- System API endpoints:
  - `/system-api/login`
  - `/system-api/user/me`
  - `/system-api/account`

---

## Impact

- Information Disclosure  
- Session Hijacking  
- Unauthorized access to sensitive user data

Exposed data may include:
- User ID
- Name and email
- Access groups / roles
- Account-related information

---

## Attack Vector

An attacker hosts a malicious webpage that issues credentialed cross-origin requests (`withCredentials: true`) to a vulnerable Eramba instance. Due to improper CORS validation, the browser allows the response to be read by the attacker’s JavaScript when the victim is authenticated.

---

## Affected Versions

### Vulnerable
- Eramba Community Edition v3.26.0  
- Eramba Enterprise Edition v3.26.0  

### Not Affected 
- Eramba v3.23.3 and earlier

---

## Fixed Version

- **Eramba v3.28.0**

The vendor confirmed the issue was resolved by strengthening CORS configuration and origin validation.
