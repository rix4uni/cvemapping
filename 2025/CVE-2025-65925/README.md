[![CVE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=CVE&message=2025--65925%20RESERVED&color=yellow)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65925)
[![Disclosure Policy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Disclosure-Coordinated-orange)](./DISCLOSURE_POLICY.md)

**Disclosure Date:** 2025-06-11  
**Vendor fix date (per vendor):** 2025-06-13  
**Researcher validation date:** 2025-06-26  
**Discovered by:** Sneden Rebello

---

## Summary
A legacy user creation API pathway allowed accounts to be created **without completing the intended email verification step**. While unverified accounts could not access product features, this bypass still violated the designed authentication/verification flow and enabled creation of unintended accounts (e.g., spam/fake registrations).

**Scope:** limited to unauthenticated sign-up flows.  
**Data exposure:** none observed; no access to existing user data or sessions.

---

## Impact (high-level)
- Creation of accounts outside intended verification controls
- Potential for spam/fake account flooding and resource/resource-usage impact
- Could serve as a stepping stone in chained attacks or social engineering

**Estimated severity:** Medium (authentication/verification logic bypass; no direct data exposure)  

**CVSS v3.1 Vector:** `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L`  
**CVSS Base Score:** **6.5 (Medium)**

---

## Affected
- **Product:** Zeroheight (SaaS platform)
- **Versions:** zeroheight (SaaS) – instances prior to **2025-06-13** (vendor-approved public version string)

---

## Mitigation (vendor)
Vendor resolved the issue by:
1. Requiring a valid verification token for all account creation flows
2. Improving validation checks before processing new account registrations

These changes ensure that accounts can only be created after completing the intended email verification process.  
Users of the platform do not need to take any action beyond ensuring they are on the current service version.
