# Coordinated Disclosure Policy

This repository follows a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process.

## Principles
- Report security issues privately to the vendor first, allowing them a reasonable time to investigate and fix.
- Avoid sharing sensitive technical details publicly if they could aid exploitation before a fix is deployed.
- Publish high-level advisories once the vendor has addressed the issue, including timelines, impact, and mitigation steps.
- Give credit to vendors who respond promptly and work collaboratively.

## This Advisory
For the Zeroheight account creation verification bypass:
- The vendor requested that public details remain high-level, without specific internal routes, endpoint names, or platform infrastructure details.
- The vendor declined to be listed as the CVE contact; this repo is maintained independently by the discoverer.
- All dates, impact statements, and fix details in the public record reflect vendor-confirmed information.
