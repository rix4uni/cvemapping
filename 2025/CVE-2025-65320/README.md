# CVE-2025-65320
CVE-2025-65320: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory in Abacre Restaurant Point of Sale (POS).

All versions of Abacre Restaurant Point of Sale (POS) up to 15.0.0.1656 are vulnerable to Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory. The application leaves valid device-bound license keys in process memory during an activation attempt. The keys can be obtained by attaching the process to a debugger and analyzing the process/memory dump, then they can be used to activate the software on the same machine without purchasing.

Below we have evidence from dynamic analysis and debugger output that shows that these keys are allocated and remain in process memory during an activation attempt.
