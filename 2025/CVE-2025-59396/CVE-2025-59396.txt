CVE-2025-59396 – WatchGuard Firebox Default Configuration Allows Unauthorized SSH Access via Port 4118
Description
The default configuration of WatchGuard Firebox devices through 2025-09-10 allows administrative access via SSH on port 4118 using the default credentials (admin:readwrite). This configuration exposes the device to remote attackers who can gain full administrative access without prior authentication.
Impact
An unauthenticated attacker can:

Retrieve sensitive information such as ARP tables, network configurations, user accounts, feature keys, and device location data.
Modify or disable firewall rules and security policies.
Perform lateral movement within the internal network.
Exfiltrate data or disrupt services.

This results in a complete compromise of the Firebox appliance and the network it protects.
Vulnerability Type
