## 🛡️ Script Overview

**Script Name:** `CVE-2025-48148.py`

This script is a professional proof-of-concept exploit for CVE-2025-48148, designed to automate the process of uploading a webshell to vulnerable WordPress sites using the StoreKeeper for WooCommerce plugin.

### ⚡ Features & Workflow

- **Automatic Nonce Extraction:**  
  Fetches the required `nonce` token directly from the target URL, ensuring reliability even if the value changes.
- **Custom Shell Creation:**  
  Generates a stealthy, valid PNG file containing a minimal PHP webshell for remote command execution.
- **Advanced Bypass Techniques:**  
  Utilizes multiple HTTP header tricks (User-Agent, Referer, X-Forwarded-For, etc.) to evade security protections and WAFs.
- **Informative Logging:**  
  Provides clear, color-coded output for every stage (extraction, upload, response).
- **Minimal Input Required:**  
  Requires only the site URL; the script automatically determines the correct upload endpoint.
- **SSL Bypass:**  
  Optionally disables SSL verification for targets with self-signed certificates.
- **Debug Mode:**  
  Enables verbose output for troubleshooting or research scenarios.
