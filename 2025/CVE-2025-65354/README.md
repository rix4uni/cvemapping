# CVE-2025-65354 — SQL Injection Vulnerability

## Summary
An SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the PuneethReddyHC event-management application version 1.0 due to improper input handling.

## Vulnerability Type
SQL Injection

## Affected Component
Endpoint: /Grocery/search_products_itname.php
Parameter: sitem_name (POST)

## Attack Type
Remote

## Impact
A remote, unauthenticated attacker can manipulate SQL queries by injecting crafted payloads into the sitem_name POST parameter. Successful exploitation may allow alteration of query logic and disclosure of database contents, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure and backend compromise.

## Affected Versions
PuneetethReddyHC event-management v1.0

## Proof of Concept
Boolean-based SQL injection payloads were used to demonstrate the issue. Example payloads:
-1' OR 5*5=25 --
-1' OR 5*5=26 --
-1' OR 2*3*1=6 AND 000648=000648 --

## Mitigation
Use parameterized queries or prepared statements, validate and whitelist user input, enforce strict input length and character restrictions, and run the database with least-privilege permissions.
