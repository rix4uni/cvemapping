# CVE-2025-60458
**UxPlay 1.72 RTSP TEARDOWN Double Free Vulnerability**

## Description
UxPlay version 1.72 contains a double free vulnerability in its RTSP request handling logic. A remote attacker can trigger multiple calls to `free()` on the same heap memory object by sending a specially crafted RTSP TEARDOWN request.

This flaw results from improper memory lifecycle management during RTSP session cleanup. When exploited, the vulnerability can cause heap corruption, leading to a denial of service (application crash). The issue may also allow arbitrary code execution.
