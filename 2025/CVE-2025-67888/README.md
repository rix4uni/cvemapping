# CVE-2025-67888

Control Web Panel <= 0.9.8.1208 (admin/index.php) OS Command Injection Vulnerability

**Affected Versions:**
Version 0.9.8.1208 and prior versions.

**Vulnerability Description:**

User input passed via the "key" GET parameter to `/admin/index.php` (when the "api" parameter is set) is not properly sanitized before being used to execute OS commands. This can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands with the privileges of the root user on the web server.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires "Softaculous" and/or "SitePad" to be installed through the Scripts Manager.

**Proof of Concept:**
```
https://[CWP]/admin/index.php?api=1&key=$(cmd)
```

**Solution:**
Upgrade to version 0.9.8.1209 or later.
