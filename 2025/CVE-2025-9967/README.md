# CVE-2025-9967

### Overview
The Orion SMS OTP Verification plugin for WordPress has a security flaw that allows unauthorized attackers to escalate their privileges through account takeover

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: requests, argparse (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Usage
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the explоit: `python explоit.py --target <target_url> --file "/path/to/Web.config"`

Options:
- `--target`: URL of the vulnerable CentreStack/TrioFox instance.
- `--file`: Relative path to the file to include (e.g., "../../../../Windows/system.ini" for testing).
- `--proxy`: Optional HTTP proxy for anonymization.


### How It Works
The vulnerability stems from inadequate user identity verification when updating passwords. Attackers who know a user's phone number can exploit this weakness to change the victim's password to a one-time password, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the victim's account. This issue affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.1.7, making it critical for website administrators to update to a secure version and mitigate potential risks.
