# The Reference of Vulnerability Same: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35191

# ===>The Impact Of Vulnerability:
# 1.CVSS =================================> 9.8 Critical
# 2.Impact Code execution ================> True
# 3.Impact Denial of Service =============> True
# 4.Impact Escalation of Privileges ======> True
# 5.Impact Information Disclosure ========> True
# 6.Affected Component ===================> /etc/shadow

# ===>Description:
# 1.This simple code is for training only And no responsibility rests with the creator of this code\ 
# The docker containers mentioned in the example are real\
# The relevant vendors have been given vulnerability alerts\
# But this has not been fixed until the release of this code.
# 2.Password default is: 12345
# 3.Path file: /home/shadow-<containerID>

# ===>Requirement:
# 1.Need to Install docker in your Linux AND Install subprocess module for python 3.X.
# 2.You need pull the your containers and next run this code(e.g: docker pull <your container>)

# ===>Instructions:
# 1.This code is only applied for containers that can be accessed to its environment using the Command below\
# but its root access is locked. 
# 2."sudo docker exec -ti <your containerID has shown in result> /bin/bash"
# 3.And in environment, type "su -" and type password by default: 12345
# 4.After run For one name of container, press 1 and enter name of container. e.g: bitnami/alertmanager
# 5.If you have a list name of containers, press 2 and enter a text file address, with this format e.g:
# bitnami/cassandra
# bitnami/alertmanager
# bitnami/prometheus

# ===>Suggestion:
# You can use for this code, with other modules e.g: "Docker SDK" - link: https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
